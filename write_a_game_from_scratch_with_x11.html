<p id="publication_date">Published on 2024-06-19.</p><h1 id="lets-write-a-video-game-from-scratch-with-x11">Let’s write a
video game from scratch with X11</h1>
<p>In a <a href="/blog/x11_x64.html">previous article</a> I’ve done the
‘Hello, world!’ of GUI: A black window with a white text, using X11
without any libraries, just talking directly over a socket.</p>
<p>In a <a href="/blog/wayland_from_scratch.html">later article</a> I’ve
done the same with Wayland, showing a static image.</p>
<p>I hope that I’ve shown that no libraries are needed and the
<del>overly complicated</del> venerable <code>libX11</code> and
<code>libxcb</code> libraries (along with the tens of separate libraries
you need to write a GUI - <code>libXau</code>, <code>libXext</code>,
<code>libXinerama</code>, etc), or the mainstream SDL, may complicate
your build and obscure what is really going on. It something does not
work, that’s tens of thousands of lines of code you have to now
troubleshoot.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that the application is tiny and
stand-alone: statically linked with the few bits of libC it uses (and
that’s it), it can be trivially compiled on every Unix, and copied
around, and it will work on every machine (with the same OS and
architecture, that is). Even on ancient Linuxes from 20 years ago.</p>
<p>However these GUIs of mine were mere proof of concepts, too
simplistic to convince the skeptic that this approach is actually
viable.</p>
<p>Per chance, I recently stumbled upon this <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40647278">Hacker News
post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s official Minesweeper app has ads, pay-to-win, and is
hundreds of MBs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I thought it would be fun to make with the same principles a
full-fledged GUI application: the cult video game Minesweeper.</p>
<p>Will it be hundred of megabytes when we finish? How much work is it
really? Can a hobbyist make this in a few hours?</p>

<p><em>Press enter to reset and press any mouse button to uncover the
cell under the mouse cursor.</em></p>
<p>The result is a ~300 KiB statically linked executable, that requires
no libraries, and uses a constant ~ 1 MiB of resident heap memory
(allocated at the start, to hold the assets). That’s roughly a thousand
times smaller in size than Microsoft’s. And it only is a few hundred
lines of code.</p>
<p>Here are the steps we need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a window</li>
<li>Upload image data (the one sprite with all the assets)</li>
<li>Draw parts of the sprite to the window</li>
<li>React to keyboard/mouse events</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Spoiler alert: every step is 1-3 X11 messages that we
need to craft and send. The only messages that we receive are the
keyboard and mouse events. It’s really not much at all!</p>
<p>We will implement this in the <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin
programming language</a> which I really enjoy. But if you want to follow
along with C or anything really, go for it. All we need is to be able to
open a Unix socket, send and receive data on it, and load an image. We
will use PNG for thats since Odin has in its standard library support
for PNGs, but we could also very easily use a simple format like PPM
(like I did in the linked Wayland article) that is trivial to parse.
Since Odin has support for both in its standard library, I stuck with
PNG.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re into writing X11 applications even with libraries,
lots of things are undocumented and this article can be a good learning
resource.</p>
<h2 id="open-a-window">Open a window</h2>
<p>That’s almost exactly the same as the first linked article so I’ll
speed run this.</p>
<p>There is one difference: we now also support the X authentication
protocol.</p>
<p>When running under XWayland, we must use authentication.</p>
<p>This requires our application to read a 16 bytes long token that’s
present in a file in the user’s home directory, and include it in the
handshake we send to the X server.</p>
<p>This mechanism is called <code>MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1</code>.</p>
<p>The catch is that this file contains multiple tokens for multiple
authentication mechanisms, and for multiple hosts. Remember, X11 is
designed to work over the network. However we only ccare here about the
entry for localhost.</p>
<p>So we need to parse a little bit. It’s basically what
<code>libXau</code> does. From its docs:</p>
<pre><code>The .Xauthority file is a binary file consisting of a sequence of entries
in the following format:
    2 bytes     Family value (second byte is as in protocol HOST)
    2 bytes     address length (always MSB first)
    A bytes     host address (as in protocol HOST)
    2 bytes     display &quot;number&quot; length (always MSB first)
    S bytes     display &quot;number&quot; string
    2 bytes     name length (always MSB first)
    N bytes     authorization name string
    2 bytes     data length (always MSB first)
    D bytes     authorization data string</code></pre>
<p>So let’s parse each entry accordingly:</p>
<pre class="odin"><code>read_x11_auth_entry :: proc(buffer: ^bytes.Buffer) -&gt; (AuthEntry, bool) {
    entry := AuthEntry{}

    {
        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, mem.ptr_to_bytes(&amp;entry.family))
        if err == .EOF {return {}, false}

        assert(err == .None)
        assert(n_read == size_of(entry.family))
    }

    address_len: u16 = 0
    {
        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, mem.ptr_to_bytes(&amp;address_len))
        assert(err == .None)

        address_len = bits.byte_swap(address_len)
        assert(n_read == size_of(address_len))
    }

    address := [256]u8{}
    {
        assert(address_len &lt;= len(address))

        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, address[:address_len])
        assert(err == .None)
        assert(n_read == cast(int)address_len)
    }

    display_number_len: u16 = 0
    {
        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, mem.ptr_to_bytes(&amp;display_number_len))
        assert(err == .None)

        display_number_len = bits.byte_swap(display_number_len)
        assert(n_read == size_of(display_number_len))
    }

    display_number := [256]u8{}
    {
        assert(display_number_len &lt;= len(display_number))

        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, display_number[:display_number_len])
        assert(err == .None)
        assert(n_read == cast(int)display_number_len)
    }

    auth_name_len: u16 = 0
    {
        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, mem.ptr_to_bytes(&amp;auth_name_len))
        assert(err == .None)

        auth_name_len = bits.byte_swap(auth_name_len)
        assert(n_read == size_of(auth_name_len))
    }

    auth_name := [256]u8{}
    {
        assert(auth_name_len &lt;= len(auth_name))

        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, auth_name[:auth_name_len])
        assert(err == .None)
        assert(n_read == cast(int)auth_name_len)

        entry.auth_name = slice.clone(auth_name[:auth_name_len])
    }

    auth_data_len: u16 = 0
    {
        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, mem.ptr_to_bytes(&amp;auth_data_len))
        assert(err == .None)

        auth_data_len = bits.byte_swap(auth_data_len)
        assert(n_read == size_of(auth_data_len))
    }

    auth_data := [256]u8{}
    {
        assert(auth_data_len &lt;= len(auth_data))

        n_read, err := bytes.buffer_read(buffer, auth_data[:auth_data_len])
        assert(err == .None)
        assert(n_read == cast(int)auth_data_len)

        entry.auth_data = slice.clone(auth_data[:auth_data_len])
    }


    return entry, true
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can sift through the different entries in the file to find the
one we are after:</p>
<pre class="odin"><code>load_x11_auth_token :: proc(allocator := context.allocator) -&gt; (token: AuthToken, ok: bool) {
    context.allocator = allocator
    defer free_all(allocator)

    filename_env := os.get_env(&quot;XAUTHORITY&quot;)

    filename :=
        len(filename_env) != 0 \
        ? filename_env \
        : filepath.join([]string{os.get_env(&quot;HOME&quot;), &quot;.Xauthority&quot;})

    data := os.read_entire_file_from_filename(filename) or_return

    buffer := bytes.Buffer{}
    bytes.buffer_init(&amp;buffer, data[:])


    for {
        auth_entry := read_x11_auth_entry(&amp;buffer) or_break

        if auth_entry.family == AUTH_ENTRY_FAMILY_LOCAL &amp;&amp;
           slice.equal(auth_entry.auth_name, transmute([]u8)AUTH_ENTRY_MAGIC_COOKIE) &amp;&amp;
           len(auth_entry.auth_data) == size_of(AuthToken) {

            mem.copy_non_overlapping(
                raw_data(&amp;token),
                raw_data(auth_entry.auth_data),
                size_of(AuthToken),
            )
            return token, true
        }
    }

    return {}, false
}</code></pre>
<p>And we use it so in <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre class="odin"><code>main :: proc() {
    auth_token, _ := load_x11_auth_token(context.temp_allocator)
}</code></pre>
<p>One interesting thing: in Odin, similarly to Zig, allocators are
passed to functions wishing to allocate memory. Contrary to Zig though,
Odin has a mechanism to make that less tedious (and a bit more implicit
as a result). Odin is nice enough to also provide us two allocators that
we can use right away: A general purpose allocator, and a temporary
allocator that uses an arena.</p>
<p>Since authentication entries can be large, we have to allocate.
However, we do not want to retain the parsed entries from the file in
memory after finding the 16 bytes token.</p>
