Ideas for articles:

- [ ] HTTP server using arenas
- [ ] Migration from mbedtls to aws-lc
- [ ] ~~ASM crypto~~
- [ ] How this blog is made. Line numbers in code snippets.
- [ ] Banjo chords
- [ ] Dtrace VM
- [ ] From BIOS to bootloader to kernel to userspace
- [ ] A faster HTTP parser than NodeJS's one
- [ ] SHA1 multi-block hash
- [ ] How CGO calls are implemented in assembly

Blog implementation:

- [ ] Use libcmark to simplify parsing
- [ ] Link to related articles at the end
- [ ] Search
  + Results are shown inline
  + Results show (some) surrounding text
  + Results have a link to the page and surrounding html section
  + Implementation: trigrams in wasm?
  + Search code/data only fetched lazily
  + Cache invalidation of the search blob e.g. when an article is created/modified?
- [ ] Articles excerpt on the home page?
- [ ] Dark mode
