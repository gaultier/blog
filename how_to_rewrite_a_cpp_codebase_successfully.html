<p id="publication_date">Published on 2024-05-03.</p><h1 id="how-to-rewrite-a-c-codebase-successfully">How to rewrite a C++
codebase successfully</h1>
<p>I recently wrote about <a
href="/blog/you_inherited_a_legacy_cpp_codebase_now_what.html">inheriting
a legacy C++ codebase</a>. At some point, although I cannot pinpoint
exactly when, a few things became clear to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one in the team but me is able - or feels confident enough - to
make a change in this codebase</li>
<li>This is a crucial project for the company and will live for years if
not decades</li>
<li>The code is pretty bad on all the criteria we care about:
correctness, maintainability, security, you name it. I don’t blame the
original developers, they were understaffed and it was written as a
prototype (the famous case of the prototype which becomes the production
code).</li>
<li>No hiring of C++ developers is planned or at least in the current
budget</li>
</ul>
<p>So it was apparent to me that sticking with C++ was a dead end. In
the end it’s a conflict of values and priorities: C++ values many things
that are not that important in this project, such as performance above
all; and it does not give any guarantees about things that are crucial
to us, such as memory and temporal safety. We bought a race car but what
we needed was a fanily-friendly 5 seater.</p>
<p>The only solution would be to train everyone in the team on C++ and
dedicate a significant amount of time rewriting the most problematic
parts of the codebase to perhaps reach a good enough state, and even
then, we have little confidence our code is robust against nation-state
attacks.</p>
<p>It’s a judgement call in the end, but that seemed to be more effort
than ‘simply’ introducing a new language and doing a rewrite.</p>
<p>I don’t actually like the term ‘rewrite’. Folks on the internet will
eagerly repeat that rewrites are a bad idea, will indubtedly fail, and
are a sign of hubris and naivity. I have experienced such rewrites, from
scratch, and yes that does not end well.</p>
<p>However, I claim, because I’ve done it, and many others before me,
that an <strong>incremental</strong> rewrite can be successful, and is
absolutely worth it. It’s all about how it is being done, so here’s how
I proceeded and I hope it can be applied in other cases, and people find
it useful.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good case study because whilst not a big codebase, it
is a complex codebase, and it’s used in production on 10+ different
operating systems and architectures, including by external customers.
This is not a toy.</p>
<p>So join me on this journey, here’s the guide to rewrite a C++
codebase successfully. And also what not do!</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>
<p>This project is a library that exposes a C API but the implementation
is C++, and it vendors C libraries (e.g. mbedtls) which we build from
source. The final artifacts are a <code>libfoo.a</code> static library
and a <code>libfoo.h</code> C header. It is used to talk to applets on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card">smart card</a> like
your credit card, ID, passport or driving license (yes, smart cards are
nowadays everywhere - you probably carry several on you right now),
since they use a <del>bizzarre</del> interesting communication protocol.
The library also implements a home-grown protocol on top of the
well-specified smart card protocol, encryption, and business logic.</p>
<p>It is meant to be part of an user-facing application running on
smartphones and Point of Sales terminals, as well as in servers running
in a datacenter or in the cloud.</p>
<p>This library is used in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android applications, through JNI</li>
<li>Go back-end services running in Kubernetes, through CGO</li>
<li>iOS applications, through Swift FFI</li>
<li>C and C++ applications running on very small 32 bits ARM boards
similar to the first Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, developers are using macOS (x64 and arm64) and Linux so
the library needs to build and run on these platforms.</p>
<p>Since external customers also integrate their applications with our
library and we do not control these environments, and because some
developer machines and servers use glibc and others musl, we also need
to work with either the glibc and the musl C libraries, as well as clang
and gcc, and expose a C89-ish API, to maximize compatibility.</p>
<p>Alright, now that the stage is set, let’s go through the steps of
rewriting this project.</p>
<h2 id="improve-the-existing-codebase">Improve the existing
codebase</h2>
<p>That’s basically all the steps in <a
href="/blog/you_inherited_a_legacy_cpp_codebase_now_what.html">Inheriting
a legacy C++ codebase</a>. We need to start the rewrite with a codebase
that builds and runs on every platform we support, with tests passing,
and a clear README explaining how to setup the project locally. This is
a small investment (a few days to a few weeks depending on the scale of
the codebase) that will pay massive dividends in the future.</p>
<p>But I think the most important point is to trim all the unused code
which is typically the majority of the codebase! No one wants to spend
time and effort on rewriting completely unused code.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you fail to convince your team and the stakeholders
to do the rewrite, you at least have improved the codebase you are now
stuck with. So it’s time well spent either way.</p>
<h2 id="get-buy-in">Get buy-in</h2>
<p>Same as in my previous article: Buy-in from teammates and
stakeholders is probably the most important thing to get, and
maintain.</p>
<p>It’s a big investment in time and thus money we are talking about, it
can only work with everyone on board.</p>
<p>Here I think the way to go is showing the naked truth and staying
very factual, in terms managers and non-technical people can understand.
This is roughly what I presented:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bus factor for this project is 1 (me)</li>
<li>Tool X shows that there are memory leaks at the rate of Y MiB/hour
which means the application using our library will be OOM killed after
around Z minutes/hours.</li>
<li>Quick and dirty fuzzing manages to make the library crash 133 times
in 10 seconds</li>
<li>Linter X detects hundreds of real issues we need to fix</li>
<li>All of these points make it really likely a hacker can exploit our
library to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) or steal secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, it’s a matter of genuinely presenting the alternative of
rewriting being cheaper in terms of time and effort compared to
improving the project with pure C++. If your teammates and boss are
reality-based, it should be a straightforward decision.</p>
<p>We use at my dayjob basically a RFC process to introduce a major
change. That’s great because it forces the person pushing for a change
to document the current issues, the possible solutions, and allowing for
a rational discussion to take place in the team. And documenting the
whole process in a shared document (that allows comments) is very
valuable because when people ask about it months later, you can just
share the link to it.</p>
<p>After the problematic situation has been presented, I think at least
3 different solutions should be presented and compared (including
sticking with pure C++), and seriously consider each option. I find it
important here to be as little emotionally invested as possible even if
one option is your favorite, and to be ready to work for possibly months
on your least favorite option, if it happens to be chosen by the
collective.</p>
<p>Ideally, if time permits, a small prototype for the preferred
solution should be done, to confirm or infirm early that it can work,
and to eliminate doubts. It’s a much more compelling argument to say:
“Of course it will work, here is prototype I made!” compared to “I hope
it will work, but who knows, oh well I guess we’ll see in 3
months…”.</p>
<p>After much debate, we settled on Rust as the new programming language
being introduced into the codebase. It’s important to note that I am not
a Rust diehard fan. I appreciate the language but it’s not perfect (see
the FFI section later), it has issues, it’s just that it solves all the
issues we have in this project, especially considering the big focus on
security (since we deal with payments), the relative similarity with the
company tech stack (Go), and the willingness of the team to learn it and
review code in it.</p>
<p>After all, the goal is also to gain additional developers, and stop
being the only person who can even touch this code.</p>
<p>I also seriously considered Go, but after doing a prototype, I was
doubtful the many limitations of CGO would allow us to achieve the
rewrite. Other teammates also had concerns on how the performance and
battery usage would look like on low-end Android and Linux devices,
especially 32 bits, having essentially two garbage collectors running
concurrenctly, the JVM one and the Go one.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-buy-in">Keeping buy-in</h2>
<p>Keeping buy-in after initially getting it is not a given, since
software always takes longer than expected and unexpected hurdles happen
all the time. Here, showing the progress through regular demos (weekly
or biweekly is a good frequence) is great for stakeholders especially
non-technical ones.</p>
<p>Addtionally, showing how long-standing issues in the old code get
automatically solved by the new code, e.g. memory leaks, or fuzzing
crashes in one function, are a great sign for stakeholders of the
quality improving and the value of the on-going effort.</p>
<p>Be prepared to repeat many many times the decision process that led
to the rewrite to your boss, your boss’s boss, the odd product manager
who’s not technical, the salesperson supporting the external customers,
etc. It’s important to nail the elevator’s pitch.</p>
<p>That applies also to teammates, who might be unsure the new
programming language ‘carries its weight’. It helps to regularly ask
them how they feel about the language, the on-going-effort, the roadmap,
etc. Also, pairing with them, so that ideally, everyone in the team
feels confident working on this project alone.</p>
<h2 id="preparations-to-introduce-the-new-language">Preparations to
introduce the new language</h2>
<p>Before adding the first line of code in the new language, I created a
Git tag <code>last-before-rust</code>. The commit right after introduced
some code in Rust.</p>
<p>This proved invaluable, because when rewriting the legacy code, I
found tens of bugs lying around, and I think that’s very typical. Also,
this rewriting effort requires time, during which other team members or
external customers may report bugs they just found.</p>
<p>Every time such a bug appeared, I switched to this Git tag, and tried
to reproduce the bug. Almost every time, the bug was already present
before the rewrite. That’s a very important information (for me, it was
a relief!) for solving the bug, and also for stakeholders. That’s the
difference in their eye between: We are improving the product by fixing
long existing bugs; or: we are introducing new bugs with our risky
changes and we should maybe stop the effort completely because it’s
harming the product.</p>
<p>Also, I think the first commit introducing the new code should add
dummy code and focus on making the build system and CI work seamlessly
on every supported platform. This is not appealing work but it’s
necessary. Also, having instructions in the README explaining a bit what
each tool does (<code>cargo</code>, <code>rustup</code>,
<code>clippy</code>, etc) is very valuable and will ease beginners into
contributing in the new language.</p>
<h2 id="incremental-rewrite">Incremental rewrite</h2>
<p>Along with stakeholder buy-in, the most important point in the
article is that only an <strong>incremental</strong> rewrite can
succeed, in my opinion. Rewriting from scratch is bound to fail, I
think. At least I have never seen it succeed, and have seen it fail many
times.</p>
<p>What does it mean, very pragmatically? Well it’s just a few rules of
thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small component is picked to be rewritting, the smallest, the
better. Ideally it is as small as one function, or one class.</li>
<li>The new implementation is written in the same Git (or whatever CVS
you use) repository as the existing code, alongside it. It’s a ‘bug for
bug’ implementation which means it does the exact same thing as the old
implementation, even if the old seems sometimes non-sensical. In some
cases, what the old code tries to do is so broken and insecure, that we
have to do something different in the new code, but that should be
rare.</li>
<li>Tests for the new implementation are written and pass (so that we
know the new implementation is likely correct)</li>
<li>Each call site calling the function/class is switched to using the
new implementation. After each replacement, the test suite is run and
passes (so that we know that nothing broke at the scale of the project;
a kind of regression testing). The change is committed. That way is
something breaks, we know exactly which change is the culprit.</li>
<li>A small PR is opened, reviewed and merged. Since our changes are
anyways incremental, it’s up to us to decide that the current diff is of
the right size for a PR. We can make the PR as big or small as we want.
We can even make a PR with only the new implementation that’s not yet
used at all.</li>
<li>Once the old function/class is not used anymore by any code, it can
be ‘garbage-collected’ i.e. safely removed. This can even be its own PR
depending on the size.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat until all of the old code has been replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>There are of course thornier cases which we’ll explore in more detail
later, but that’s the gist of it. What’s crucial is that each commit on
the main branch builds and runs fine. At not point the codebase is every
broken, does not build, or is in an unknown state.</p>
<p>It’s actually not much different from the way I do a refactor in a
codebase with just one programming language.</p>
<p>What’s very important to avoid are big PRs that are thousands lines
long and nobody wants to review them, or long running branches that
effectively create a multiverse inside the codebase. It’s the same as
regular software development, really.</p>
<p>Here are a few additional tips I recommend doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from the leaves of the call graph is much easier than from
the root. For example, if <code>foo</code> calls <code>bar</code> which
calls <code>baz</code>, first rewriting <code>baz</code> then
<code>bar</code> then <code>foo</code> is straightforward, but the
reverse is usually not true.</li>
<li>Thus, mapping out at the start from a high-level what are the
existing components and which component calls out to which other
component is invaluable in that regard, but also for establishing a
rough roadmap for the rewrite, and reporting on the progress (“3
components have been rewritten, 2 left to do!”).</li>
<li>Port the code comments from the old code to the new code if they
make sense and add value</li>
<li>If you can use automated tools (search and replace, or tools
operating at the AST level) to change every call site to use the new
implementation, it’ll make your reviewers very happy, and save you hours
and hours of debugging because of a copy-paste mistake</li>
<li>Since Rust and C++ basically only can communicate through a C API (I
am aware of experimental projects to make them talk directly but we did
not use those), it means that each Rust function must be accompanied by
a corresponding C function signature, so that C++ can call it as a C
function. I recommend automating this process with <a
href="https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen">cbindgen</a>. I have
encountered some limitations with it but it’s very useful, especially to
keep the implementation (in Rust) and the API (in C) in sync, or if your
teammates are not comfortable with C. I added the call to
<code>cbindgen</code> to CMake so that rebuilding the C++ project would
automatically run <code>cbindgen</code> as well as
<code>cargo build</code> for the right target in the right mode (debug
or release) for the right platforms (<code>--target=...</code>). DevUX
matters!</li>
<li>When rewriting a function/class, port the tests for this
function/class to the new implementation to avoid reducing the code
coverage each time</li>
<li>Make the old and the new test suites fast so that the iteration time
is short</li>
<li>When a divergence is detected (a difference in output or side
effects between the old and the new implementation), observe with tests
or within the debugger the output of the old implementation (that’s
where the initial Git tag comes handy) in detail so that you can correct
the new implementation. Some people even develop big test suites
verifying that the output of the old and the new implementation are
exactly the same.</li>
<li>Since it’s a bug-for-bug rewrite, <em>what</em> the new
implementation does may seem weird or unnecessarily convulated but shall
be kept (at least as a first pass). However, <em>how</em> it does it in
the new code should be up to the best software engineering standards,
that means tests, fuzzing, documentation, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there is one hidden advantage of doing an incremental
rewrite. A from-scratch rewrite is all or nothing, if it does not fully
complete and replace the old implementation, it’s useless and wasteful.
However, an incremental rewrite is immediately useful, may be pause and
continued a number of times, and even if the funding gets cut short and
it never fully completes, it’s still a clear improvement over the
starting point.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing">Fuzzing</h2>
<p>I am a fan a fuzzing, it’s great. Almost every time I fuzz some code,
I find an corner case I did not think about, especially when doing
parsing.</p>
<p>I added fuzzing to the project so that every new Rust function is
fuzzed. I initially used <a
href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl.html">AFL</a> but then turned
to <a
href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html">cargo-fuzz</a>,
and I’ll explain why.</p>
<p>Fuzzing is only useful if code coverage is <a
href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/03/01/toward-more-effective-curl-fuzzing/">high</a>.
The worst that can happen is to dedicate serious time to setup fuzzing,
to only discover at the end that the same few branches are always taken
during fuzzing.</p>
<p>Coverage can only be improved if developers can easily see exactly
which branches are being executed during fuzzing. And I could not find
an easy way with AFL to get a hold on that data.</p>
<p>Using <code>cargo-fuzz</code> and various LLVM tools, I wrote a small
shell script to visualize exactly which branches are taken during
fuzzing as well as the code coverage in percents for each file and for
the project as a whole (right now it’s at around 90%).</p>
<p>To get to a high coverage, the quality of the corpus data is
paramount, since fuzzing works by doing small mutations of this corpus
and observing which branches are taken as a result.</p>
<p>I realized that the existing tests in C++ had lots of useful data in
them, e.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">const</span> <span class="bu">std::</span>vector<span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="dt">char</span><span class="op">&gt;</span> input <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span><span class="bn">0x32</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="bn">0x01</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="bn">0x49</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="op">...};</span> <span class="co">// &lt;= This is the interesting data.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">assert</span><span class="op">(</span>foo<span class="op">(</span>input<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="op">...);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So I had the idea of extracting all the <code>input = ...</code> data
from the tests to build a good fuzzing corpus. My first go at it was a
hand-written quick and dirty C++ lexer. It worked but it was clunky.
Right after I finished it, I thought: why don’t I use
<code>tree-sitter</code> to properly parse C++?</p>
<p>And so I did, and it turned out great, just 300 lines of Rust walking
through each <code>TestXXX.cpp</code> file in the repository and using
tree-sitter to extract each pattern. I used the query language of
tree-sitter to do so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> query <span class="op">=</span> <span class="pp">tree_sitter::Query::</span>new(</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="pp">tree_sitter_cpp::</span>language()<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">&quot;(initializer_list (number_literal)+) @capture&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The tree-sitter website thankfully has a playground where I could
experiment and tweak the query and see the results live.</p>
<p>As time went on and more and more C++ tests were migrated to Rust
tests, it was very easy to extend this small Rust program that builds
the corpus data, to also scan the Rust tests!</p>
<p>A typical Rust test would look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">const</span> INPUT<span class="op">:</span> [<span class="dt">u8</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="dv">4</span>] <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="dv">0x01</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x02</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x03</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x04</span>]<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &lt;= This is the interesting data.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">assert_eq!</span>(foo(<span class="op">&amp;</span>INPUT)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="op">...</span>)<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And the query to extract the interesting data would be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> query <span class="op">=</span> <span class="pp">tree_sitter::Query::</span>new(</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="pp">tree_sitter_rust::</span>language()<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co">// </span><span class="al">TODO</span><span class="co">: Maybe make this query more specific with:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co">// `(let_declaration value: (array_expression (integer_literal)+)) @capture`.</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co">// But in a few cases, the byte array is defined with `const`, not `let`.</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">&quot;(array_expression (integer_literal)+) @capture&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However I discovered that not all data was successfully extracted.
What about this code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">const</span> BAR <span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">u8</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0x42</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">const</span> INPUT<span class="op">:</span> [<span class="dt">u8</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="dv">4</span>] <span class="op">=</span> [BAR<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x02</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x03</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">0x04</span>]<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">// &lt;= This is the interesting data.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">assert_eq!</span>(foo(<span class="op">&amp;</span>INPUT)<span class="op">,</span> <span class="op">...</span>)<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a constant <code>BAR</code> which trips up tree-sitter,
because it only see a literal (i.e. 3 letters: ‘B’, ‘A’ and ‘R’) and
does not know its value.</p>
<p>The way I solved this issue was to do two passes: once to collect all
constants along with their values in a map, and then a second pass to
find all arrays in tests:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">let</span> query <span class="op">=</span> <span class="pp">tree_sitter::Query::</span>new(</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="pp">tree_sitter_rust::</span>language()<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="st">&quot;(const_item value: (integer_literal)) @capture &quot;</span><span class="op">,</span></span>

<p>So that we can then resolve the literals to their numeric value.</p>
<p>That’s how I implemented a compiler for the Kotlin programming
language in the past and it worked great. Maybe there are more advanced
approaches but this one is dead-simple and fast so it’s good enough for
us.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy with how this turned out, scanning all C++ and Rust
files to find interesting test data in them to build the corpus. I think
this was key to move from the initial 20% code coverage with fuzzing
(using a few hard-coded corpus files) to 90%. It’s fast too.</p>
<p>Also, it means the corpus gets better each time we had a test (be it
in C++ or Rust), for free.</p>
<p>Does it mean that the corpus will grow to an extreme size? Well,
worry not, because LLVM comes with a fuzzing corpus minimizer:</p>
<pre><code># Minimize the fuzzing corpus (in place).
cargo +nightly fuzz cmin [...]</code></pre>
<p>For each file in the corpus, it feeds it as input to our code,
observes which branches are taken, and if a new set of branches is
taken, this file remains (or perhaps gets minimized even more, not sure
how smart this tool is). Otherwise it is deemed a duplicate and is
trimmed.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We generate the corpus with our program</li>
<li>Minimize it</li>
<li>Run the fuzzing for however long we wish. It runs in CI for every
commit and developers can also run it locally.</li>
<li>When fuzzing is complete, we print the code coverage statistics</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we still have the option to add manually crafted files to
this corpus if we wish. For example after hitting a bug in the wild, and
fixing it, we can add a reproducer file to the corpus as a kind of
regression test.</p>
<h2 id="pure-rust-vs-interop-ffi">Pure Rust vs interop (FFI)</h2>
<p>Writing Rust has been a joy, even for more junior developers in the
team. Pure Rust code was pretty much 100% correct on the first try.</p>
<p>However we had to use <code>unsafe {}</code> blocks in the FFI layer.
We segregated all the FFI code to one file, and converted the C FFI
structs to Rust idiomatic structs as soon as possible, so that the bulk
of the Rust code can be idiomatic and safe.</p>
<p>But that means this FFI code is the most likely part of the Rust code
to have bugs. To get some confidence in its correctness, we write Rust
tests using the C FFI functions (as if we were a C consumer of the
library) running under <a
href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> which acts as valgrind
essentially, simulating a CPU and checking that our code is memory safe.
Tests run perhaps 5 to 10 times as slow as without Miri but this has
proven invaluable since it detected many bugs ranging from alignment
issues to memory leaks and use-after-free issues.</p>
<p>We run tests under Miri in CI to make sure each commit is reasonably
safe.</p>
<p>So beware: introducing Rust to a C or C++ codebase may actually
introduce new memory safety issues, usually all located in the FFI
code.</p>
<p>Thankfully that’s a better situation to be in than to have to inspect
all of the codebase when a memory issue is detected.</p>
<h2 id="c-ffi-in-rust-is-cumbersome">C FFI in Rust is cumbersome</h2>
<p>The root cause for all these issues is that the C API that C++ and
Rust use to call each other is very limited in its expresiveness w.r.t
ownership, as well as many Rust types not being marked
<code>#[repr(C)]</code>, even types you would expect to, such as
<code>Option</code>, <code>Vec</code> or <code>&amp;[u8]</code>. That
means that you have to define your own equivalent types:</p>

<p>Apparently, Rust developers do not want to commit to a particular ABI
for these types, to avoid missing out on some future optimizations. So
it means that every Rust struct now needs the equivalent “FFI friendly”
struct along with conversion functions (usually implemented as
<code>Into</code> for convenience):</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo&lt;&#39;a&gt; {
    x: Option&lt;usize&gt;,
    y: &amp;&#39;a [u8],
    z: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,
}


#[repr(C)]
struct FooC {
    x: OptionC&lt;usize&gt;,
    y: ByteSliceView,
    z: OwningArrayC&lt;u8&gt;,
}</code></pre>
<p>Which is cumbersome but still fine, especially since Rust has
powerful macros (which I investigated using but did not eventually).
However, since Rust also does not have great idiomatic support for
custom allocators, we stuck with the standard memory allocator, which
meant that each struct with heap-allocated fields has to have a
deallocation function:</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn foo_free(foo: &amp;FooC) {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>And the C or C++ calling code would have to do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>FooC foo<span class="op">{};</span></span>

<p>which feels right at home for Go developers, and is an improvement
over the style in use in the old C++ code where it was fully manual
calls to new/delete.</p>
<p>Still, it’s more work than what you’d have to do in pure idiomatic
Rust or C++ code (or even C code with arenas for that matter).</p>
<p>In Zig or Odin, I would probably have used arenas to avoid that, or a
general allocator with <code>defer</code>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky, <code>cargo test</code> would fail at the last
assertion saying that the value is not what we expected, but in my case
it passed every time, and so the bug was undetected for some time.
That’s because we unknowingly introduced undefined behavior, and as
such, how or if it manifests is impossible to tell.</p>
<p>Let’s run the test with Miri:</p>

<p>Miri is great, I tell you.</p>
<p>The issue here is that we essentially return a pointer to local
variable (<code>x</code>) from inside the function, so the pointer is
dangling.</p>

valgrind:</p>

<p>Which is not very informative, but better than nothing.
<code>Miri</code>’s output is much more actionable.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, Rust’s FFI capabilities work but are tedious are
error-prone in my opinion, and so require extra care and testing with
Miri/fuzzing, with high code coverage of the FFI functions. It’s not
enough to only test the pure (non FFI) Rust code.</p>
<h2 id="another-example-of-a-real-bug-at-the-ffi-boundary">Another
example of a real bug at the FFI boundary</h2>
<p>When I started this rewrite, I was under the impression that the Rust
standard library uses the C memory allocator (basically,
<code>malloc</code>) under the covers when it needs to allocate some
memory.</p>
<p>However, I quickly discovered that it is not (anymore?) the case, it
uses its own allocator - at least on Linux where there is no C library
shipping with the kernel. Miri again is the MVP here since it detected
the issue of mixing the C and Rust allocations which prompted this
section.</p>
<p>As Bryan Cantrill once said: “glibc on Linux, it’s just, like, your
opinion dude”. Meaning, glibc is just one option, among many, since
Linux is just the kernel and does not ship with a libC. So the Rust
standard library cannot expect a given C library on every Linux system,
like it would be on macOS or the BSDs or Illumos. All of that to say: it
implements its own memory allocator.</p>
<p>The consequence of this, is that allocating memory on the C/C++ side,
and freeing it on the Rust side, is undefined behavior: it amounts to
freeing a pointer that was never allocated by this allocator. And
vice-versa, allocating a pointer from Rust and freeing it from C.</p>
<p>That has dire consequences since most memory allocators do not detect
this in Release mode. You might free completely unrelated memory leading
to use-after-free later, or corrupt the memory allocator structures.
It’s bad.</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified example of code that triggered this issue:</p>

<p>This is undefined behavior if the array is of size 1, since the Rust
allocator will free a pointer allocated by the C allocator, and address
sanitizer catches it:</p>
<pre><code>SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: alloc-dealloc-mismatch /home/runner/work/llvm-project/llvm-project/final/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:52:3 in free</code></pre>
<p>However, it is only detected with sanitizers on and if a test (or
fuzzing) triggers this case. Or by Miri if a Rust test covers this
function.</p>
<hr />
<p>So I recommend sticking to one ‘side’ , be it C/C++ or Rust, of the
FFI boundary, to allocate and free all the memory using in FFI
structures. Rust has an edge here since the long-term goal is to have
100% of Rust so it will have to allocate all the memory anyway in the
end.</p>
<p>Depending on the existing code style, it might be hard to ensure that
the C/C++ allocator is not used at all for structures used in FFI, due
to abstractions and hidden memory allocations.</p>
<p>One possible solution (which I did not implement but considered) is
making FFI structures a simple opaque pointer (or ‘handle’) so that the
caller has to use FFI functions to allocate and free this structure.
That also means implementing getter/setters for certain fields since the
structures are now opaque. It maximizes the ABI compatibility, since the
caller cannot rely on a given struct size, alignement, or fields.</p>
<p>However that means more work and more functions in the API.</p>
<p><code>libcurl</code> is an example of such an approach,
<code>libuv</code> is an example of a library which did not do this
initially, but plans to move to this approach in future versions, which
would be a breaking change for clients.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</h2>
<p>Rust has great cross-compilation support; C++ not so much.
Nonetheless I managed to coerced CMake into cross-compiling to every
platform we support from my Linux laptop. After using Docker for more
than 10 years I am firmly against using Docker for that, it’s just
clunky and slow and not a good fit.</p>
<p>That way, I can even cross-compile tests and example programs in C or
C++ using the library and run them inside <code>qemu</code> to make sure
all platforms work as expected.</p>
<p>I took inspiration from the CMake code in the Android project, which
has to cross-compile for many architectures. Did you know that Android
supports x86 (which is 32 bits), x86_64, arm (which is 32 bits), aarch64
(sometimes called arm64), and more?</p>
<p>In short, you instruct CMake to cross-compile by supplying on the
command-line the variables <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</code> and
<code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code>, which are the equivalent of
<code>GOARCH</code> and <code>GOOS</code> if you are familiar with Go.
E.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> cmake <span class="at">-B</span> .build <span class="at">-S</span> src <span class="at">-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER</span><span class="op">=</span>clang <span class="at">-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</span><span class="op">=</span>clang++ <span class="at">-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</span><span class="op">=</span>Linux <span class="at">-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</span><span class="op">=</span>arm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the Rust side, you tell <code>cargo</code> to cross-compile by
supplying the <code>--target</code> command-line argument, e.g.:
<code>--target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>. This works by virtue of
installing the pre-compiled toolchain for this platform with
<code>rustup</code> first:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So now we have to convert in CMake
<code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE</code> and
<code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code> into a target triple that clang and cargo
can understand. Of course you have to do all the hard work yourself.
This is complicated by lots of factors like Apple using the architecture
name <code>arm64</code> instead of <code>aarch64</code>, iOS
peculiarities, soft vs hard float, arm having multiple variants (v6, v7,
v8, etc), and so on. Your mileage may vary. We opt-in into using musl
with a CMake command line option, on Linux.</p>
<p>Here it is in all its glory:</p>

<p>There was a lot of trial and error as you can guess.</p>
<p>Also, gcc is not directly supported for cross-compilation in this
approach because gcc does not support a <code>--target</code> option
like clang does, since it’s not a cross-compiler. You have to download
the variant you need e.g. <code>gcc-9-i686-linux-gnu</code> to compile
for x86, and set <code>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</code> and
<code>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</code> to <code>gcc-9-i686-linux-gnu</code>.
However, in that case you are not setting <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</code>
and <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</code> since it’s in theory not
cross-compiling, so <code>cargo</code> will not have its
<code>--target</code> option filled, so it won’t work for the Rust code.
I advise sticking with clang in this setup. Still, when not
cross-compiling, gcc works fine.</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote a Lua script to cross-compile for every platform we
support to make sure I did not break anything. I resorted to using the
Zig toolchain (not the language) to be able to statically link with musl
or cross-compile from Linux to iOS which I could not achieve with pure
clang. However this is only my local setup, we do not use the Zig
toolchain when building the production artifacts (e.g. the iOS build is
done in a macOS virtual machine).</p>
<p>This is very useful also if you have several compile-time feature
flags and want to build in different configurations for all platforms,
e.g. enable/disable logs at compile time:</p>

<p>I look forward to only having Rust code and deleting all of this
convoluted stuff.</p>
<p>That’s something that people do not mention enough when saying that
modern C++ is good enough and secure enough. Well, first I disagree with
this statement, but more broadly, the C++ toolchain to cross-compile
sucks. You only have clang that can cross-compile in theory but in
practice you have to resort to the Zig toolchain to automate
cross-compiling the standard library etc.</p>
<p>Also, developers not deeply familiar with either C or C++ do not want
to touch all this CMake/Autotools with a ten-foot pole. And I understand
them. Stockhold syndrom notwithstanding, these are pretty mediocre,
slow, convoluted, niche programming languages. Once you are used to
simply typing <code>go build</code> or <code>cargo build</code>, you
really start to ask yourself if those weird things are worth anyone’s
time.</p>
